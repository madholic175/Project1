# Backup_Control.md

## Script Interaction Explanation:

### **When you run `backup_project.sh` manually:**
- **NO** - It does NOT trigger `file_monitor.sh` or `monitor_control.sh`
- The backup script runs independently and just creates backups
- It's a standalone script that can be used without the monitoring system

### **When `file_monitor.sh` is running:**
- **YES** - The monitor script calls `backup_project.sh` automatically when it detects file changes
- The monitor watches for file changes and then executes the backup script
- This is a one-way relationship: monitor → backup (not the other way around)

### **Flow Diagram:**
```
Manual Usage:
You → backup_project.sh → Creates backups

Automatic Usage:
file_monitor.sh → Detects changes → Calls backup_project.sh → Creates backups

Control:
monitor_control.sh → Starts/stops file_monitor.sh
```

## **Key Points:**

### **1. Independent Scripts:**
- `backup_project.sh` = Standalone backup tool
- `file_monitor.sh` = File watcher that calls backup_project.sh
- `monitor_control.sh` = Control interface for starting/stopping monitor

### **2. Relationship:**
- **backup_project.sh** → Does NOT trigger other scripts
- **file_monitor.sh** → DOES call backup_project.sh (line 30 in the script: `"$BACKUP_SCRIPT"`)
- **monitor_control.sh** → DOES start/stop file_monitor.sh

### **3. What This Means:**
- ✅ You can run `./backup_project.sh` manually anytime without affecting the monitor
- ✅ The monitor (if running) will automatically call `backup_project.sh` when files change
- ✅ Both approaches work together seamlessly
- ✅ No conflicts or recursive calls

### **4. Current State:**
Your monitor IS currently running (PID: 1548569), so:
- Manual backups: Still work fine
- Automatic backups: Also happening when files change
- Both are independent and don't interfere with each other

This design gives you maximum flexibility - you can use manual backups when needed while still having automatic monitoring running in the background!
