# Project Backup Scheme

## Overview
This project is an example project aimed at demonstrating various functionalities and best practices. Further details will be added as the project evolves.

## Installation
Instructions for setting up the project will be updated here.

## Usage
Examples and usage instructions will be provided as the project develops.

## Backup Scheme
To ensure the safety of your project files and changes, an enhanced automatic backup system is implemented:

### Git Version Control
- **Track Changes:** Use `git add .` to stage changes and `git commit -m "Your message"` to save snapshots
- **Revert Changes:** Use `git checkout <commit-hash>` or `git reset` to revert to previous states if needed

### Automatic File Monitoring & Backup System
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Automatically detects file changes using `inotify` and triggers backups
- **Daily Full Backups:** One complete timestamped backup per day stored in `Project1_Backups/full/`
- **Incremental Backups:** Captures recent changes with timestamp, overwrites previous to save space in `Project1_Backups/incremental/`
- **7-Day Retention:** Automatically removes full backups older than 7 days, single incremental backup overwrites itself
- **Smart Debouncing:** Waits for file activity to settle before triggering backup to avoid excessive backups

### Monitor Control Commands
```bash
# Start automatic monitoring
./monitor_control.sh start

# Check monitoring status
./monitor_control.sh status

# Stop monitoring
./monitor_control.sh stop

# Restart monitoring
./monitor_control.sh restart

# Watch live activity
tail -f monitor.log
```

### Backup Structure
```
Project1_Backups/
â”œâ”€â”€ full/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Project1_Full_YYYYMMDD.tar.gz (timestamped daily backups, 7-day retention)
â””â”€â”€ incremental/
    â””â”€â”€ Project1_Incremental_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.tar.gz (timestamped, overwrites previous)
```

### Backup Behavior
- **Automatic Triggers:** File creation, modification, deletion, or move operations
- **Incremental:** Single timestamped backup, overwrites previous to minimize storage
- **Full Backups:** Timestamped daily, automatically deleted after 7 days
- **Space Efficient:** Maintains maximum 7 full backups + 1 incremental backup
- **Lock Protection:** Prevents multiple simultaneous backups

### Restoring from Backup
- **From Full Backup:** `tar -xzf Project1_Full_YYYYMMDD.tar.gz`
- **From Incremental:** `tar -xzf Project1_Incremental_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.tar.gz`

### Manual Backup Option
You can still run manual backups if needed: `./backup_project.sh`

The automatic monitoring system ensures you never lose work due to forgotten manual backups!
